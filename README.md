# React-Guess-The-Country
This project is a simple country guessing game built with React and Vite. The player is presented with a random country from the REST Countries API, and they have to guess its name by typing in an input field. The game will check if the player's guess matches the country's common name. For styling, we use Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
